## About

In Total Power, the weight of a nation doesn’t sit on your shoulders—it sits at the tip of your pen.

You’ve just been inaugurated. The crowds are cheering, the cameras are flashing, and the mahogany desk in the Office is finally yours. But as the doors close and the silence sets in, the reality of the chair becomes clear: every choice is a trade-off, and every decree has a price.

## The Vision

Total Power is a deep, text-based political fiction strategy game that places you at the heart of a volatile government. You aren’t just playing a role; you are defining a legacy. Will you be the visionary who strengthens the foundations of liberty, or the "Strongman" who decides that the people are too chaotic to rule themselves?

## Key Features

The Moral Compass: Navigate complex branching narratives where "right" and "wrong" are often buried under layers of political necessity.

Ideological Warfare: Shift the country’s alignment on a dynamic scale between Radical Democracy and Totalitarianism.

Crisis Management: Handle everything from economic collapses and civil unrest to international espionage and shadow cabinet conspiracies.

The Legacy System: Your term isn't forever. Whether you leave office via a peaceful transition, a term limit, or a violent coup depends entirely on the precedents you set.

"Power doesn't corrupt; it reveals. By the end of your first term, the world will know exactly who you are."

## How Will You Rule?

Will you dismantle the secret police to earn the love of the masses, even if it leaves you vulnerable to an assassination plot? Or will you censor the press "for the sake of national stability"?

In Total Power, the constitution is just a piece of paper. You are the one who decides what the ink says.
